<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
There are many social networks nowadays, each serving different groups of users. One of the most popular ones is `Twitter` where users can share their thoughts with the rest of the world. Twitter provides many features and is easy to use. Since it has became so popular nowadays, I have decided to develop a simple simulation of Twitter using `python` and `MySQL` as database(GUI is not developed in this project).
Some of the practical features of twitter have been developed which are mentioned in the next part. 
I have named my very own social network `Ghanari` which is the translation of Twitter in persian. Also each tweet is called `Ava` in this project.
